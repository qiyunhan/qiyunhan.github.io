I am currently a Ph.D student at [the Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eeen/index.html) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), Beijing, China. I have received the B.E. degree from the Electronic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University in July 2020. My current research mainly focuses new generation GNSS signal processing.
