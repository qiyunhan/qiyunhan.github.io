I am currently a Ph.D student at the Department of Electronic Engineering in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. I have received the B.E. degree from the Electronic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University in July 2020. My current research mainly focuses on high-precision processing of new generation GNSS signals.
