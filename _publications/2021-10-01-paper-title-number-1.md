title: "General design methodology of code multi‐correlator discriminator for GNSS multipath mitigation"
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'In this paper, a general design methodology for designing code MCD structures based on heuristic optimisation for multi‐path mitigation is proposed. The proposed method can specifically design code MCD structures for signals with various modulations and receivers with different bandwidths, indicating the adaptability of the proposed method. Multi‐path mitigation performances of such designed structures are better than those of traditional code discriminator structures with strong tracking robustness and slight degradation of thermal noise performance. Designed code MCD structures are also insensitive to multi‐path relative amplitudes and bandwidths of receivers, ensuring the practicality of the designed code MCD structures.'
