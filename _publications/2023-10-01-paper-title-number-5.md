title: "Accelerated SF-PPP Convergence of BDS-3 B1 Band by Widieband Observations"
collection: Accepted
permalink: 
excerpt: 'This paper introduces the B1 wideband signal observations into B1 SF-PPP for the first time. By establishing B1 SF-PPP model with three types of B1 wideband signal observations, real data experiments successfully demonstrate that the B1 wideband signal observations not only have better thermal noise and anti-multipath performances, but also can further accelerate B1 SF-PPP convergence, thus providing a faster SF-PPP solution for BDS-3 B1 band.'
