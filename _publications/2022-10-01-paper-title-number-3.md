**Abstract**
This paper proposes a robust unambiguous ranging technique, which utilizes an ambiguity model established by observations derived from CAT to resolve ambiguous ranging results. Simulation experiments are implemented to quantitatively evaluate the proposed method’s performance and explore its effective ranges. Real data experiments are also implemented in static and dynamic cases to furtherly verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, exhibiting that the proposed method can take full advantage of the high-precision ranging potential contained in BDS-3 B1 wideband composite signals with less ambiguity threats.
