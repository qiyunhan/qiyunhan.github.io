excerpt: 'This paper proposes a general design method for two-dimensional multi-correlator anti-multipath tracking (TMAT) structures based on heuristic optimization. Compared with 2-D tracking loops equipped with traditional anti-multipath structures, such as narrow early minus late (NEML) and double delta (DD) structures, TMAT structures designed for different signals with different bandwidths always have better multipath mitigation performance without any degradation of tracking robustness. According to case studies, because of the great anti-multipath improvement of TMAT structures, the slight degradation in thermal noise performance can be acceptable. Also, the designed TMAT structures are insensitive to relative amplitude of multipath and bandwidth of signals, indicating the great practicality of this technique.'
